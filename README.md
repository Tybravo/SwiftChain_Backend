# SwiftChain_Backend

**SwiftChain_Backend** is the core API service for **SwiftChain**, a Blockchain-Powered Logistics & Escrow Delivery Platform. It connects individuals, businesses, and independent drivers in a decentralized logistics economy, ensuring trust through escrow payments and smart contracts.

---

## 📌 Business Overview

**SwiftChain** revolutionizes logistics by enabling existing transport assets (motorcycles, trucks, independent couriers) to participate in a shared economy. It addresses trust issues in delivery services through blockchain-powered escrow mechanisms.

### Core Problem Solved

Traditional logistics are often centralized, expensive, and lack trust between unknown parties. SwiftChain bridges this gap by locking payments in escrow until delivery is confirmed.

### Financial Inclusion Benefits

The platform empowers:

- **Small Logistics Operators & Drivers**: Access to a steady stream of delivery requests.
- **Underserved Communities**: Access to global payments via Stellar's borderless network.
- **Cross-Border Merchants**: Seamless settlement for international goods movement.

### Target Market

- 🌍 **African Logistics Markets**
- 🏢 **SMEs & E-commerce Merchants**
- 🛵 **Courier Startups & Independent Drivers**
- 🚢 **Cross-Border Trade Facilitators**

### Revenue Model

1. **Delivery Commission Fees**: Percentage of each successful delivery.
2. **Escrow Service Charges**: Small fee for securing the transaction.
3. **Enterprise Logistics APIs**: Subscription for high-volume business integration.
4. **Cross-Border Settlement Fees**: Currency conversion and transfer fees.
5. **Premium Analytics**: Insights for fleet owners and businesses.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

SwiftChain operates as a distributed system across three repositories:

1.  **SwiftChain_Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS (User Interface)
2.  **SwiftChain_Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript + MongoDB (Core Logic)
3.  **SwiftChain_SmartContract**: Stellar Soroban + Rust (Escrow & Trust)

### Backend Responsibilities

The backend serves as the central hub connecting the frontend, database, and blockchain layers. Key responsibilities include:

- **REST API** for platform operations.
- **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, RBAC).
- **Delivery & Shipment Management** (CRUD, Tracking).
- **Driver Assignment Algorithms**.
- **File Upload Services** (Receipts, Proof of Delivery).
- **Real-Time Updates** (WebSockets/Polling).
- **Blockchain Integration Layer** (Stellar/Soroban events).

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary / AWS S3
- **Real-Time**: Socket.io / Polling
- **Documentation**: Swagger / OpenAPI
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

---

## 🚀 Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Roles

- **Users**: Register, Login, Create Requests.
- **Drivers**: Register, Verify, Accept Jobs.
- **Admins**: Platform Management.
- **Security**: JWT-based stateless auth with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### 2. Delivery Operations

- **Create Delivery**: Customer details, pickup/drop-off locations, package info.
- **Delivery List**: Filtering, pagination, and status tracking.
- **Status Workflow**: Pending -> Assigned -> Picked Up -> In Transit -> Delivered.

### 3. Driver Assignment

- Mechanism to assign available drivers to pending delivery requests.

### 4. Shipments & Escrow

- **Shipment Tracking**: Detailed tracking of goods.
- **Escrow Logic**: Integration with Stellar Smart Contracts to lock/release funds based on delivery status.

### 5. File Uploads

- Secure upload of delivery receipts, images, and documents (PDF/JPG).

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user/driver.
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate and retrieve token.

### Deliveries

- `POST /deliveries` - Create a new delivery request.
- `GET /deliveries` - Retrieve a list of deliveries (with filters).
- `PUT /deliveries/:id/assign` - Assign a driver to a delivery.

### Shipments

- `POST /shipments` - Create a shipment record.
- `GET /shipments` - Get shipment details.

### Uploads

- `POST /uploads` - Upload proof of delivery or documents.
